Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);

if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with

(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)

used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

your pricing proposal:


(1)
Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price
revision/redetermination, letter contract, unpriced order, or other);

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying
or identified in the proposal. In addition, you must annotate any
future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with

(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.

D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably

Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types

II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.

You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.

If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.

items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.

material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and

adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.

(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.

summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately

price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price
revision/redetermination, letter contract, unpriced order, or other);

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)

(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)

used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price
revision/redetermination, letter contract, unpriced order, or other);

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)

(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying
or identified in the proposal. In addition, you must annotate any
future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying
or identified in the proposal. In addition, you must annotate any
future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.

price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with

D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.

(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).


 III. Formats

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)

(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)

If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)

(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)

including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)

price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying
or identified in the proposal. In addition, you must annotate any
future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price
revision/redetermination, letter contract, unpriced order, or other);

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)
Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price

official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)

(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately

future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Table 15-2—Instructions
for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing
Data Are Required

This document provides instructions
for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or
pricing data are required.



Note 1. There is a clear distinction
between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making
available books, records, and other documents without identification.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably
available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or
by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative. As later data come into your possession, it should
be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that
clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror’s price proposal.
The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date
agreed upon between the parties if applicable.



Note 2. By submitting your proposal,
you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative
the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing
proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award.
It may include those books, records, documents, and other types
of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically
referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing)
that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


 
                                          I. General Instructions

your pricing proposal:


(1)
Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number;


(2)
Name and address of offeror;


(3)
Name and telephone number of point of contact;


(4)
Name of contract administration office (if available);


(5)

or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency
official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and,
if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent
with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an
explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established
estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part  31,
Cost Principles, and, if not, an explanation;


(9)
The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or
actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in
FAR 15.403-5(b)(1) and Table
15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer
and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time
before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting
procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced
or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.


(10)
Date of submission; and


(11)
Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.


B.
In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately
referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying
or identified in the proposal. In addition, you must annotate any
future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on
price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental
index.


C.
As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with
your proposal-


(1)
Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly
identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data
are included as part of the proposal.


(2)
Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process,
including-


(i)
The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods
used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known
data; and


(ii)
The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed
price.


D.
You must show the relationship between line item prices and the
total contract price.You must attach cost-element breakdowns for
each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed
in the ""Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries"" section of
this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost
element, consistent with your cost accounting system.


E.
When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide
summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of
cost.


F.
Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission
of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.


G.
If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives
on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include
a copy, and describe its nature.


H.
As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier
date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from
the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.406-2, submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.


II. Cost Elements



Depending on your system, you
must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as
applicable:



A. Materials
and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual
material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line
items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice
prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies,
and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items
proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price.
Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost
analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data
are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part
of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts
expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor
certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost
or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data
as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements
also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified
cost or pricing data.


 (1) Adequate
Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of competition
and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of
price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,
material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate
threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced
on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational
transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive
commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the
contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).



(2) All Other. Obtain certified cost
or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions
(such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding
the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 and
not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) ( i.e.,
adequate price competition, commercial
products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation
or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing
source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary
of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data
submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,
or purchase order that is the lower of either $15 million or more,
or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold
and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price.
Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your
estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and
the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including
those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount
of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer
may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals
in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be
accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement,
or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime
contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime
contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s
data. For standard commercial
products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based
on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide
a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost
or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective
source’s proposal.When submission of a prospective source’s certified
cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph,
it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing
data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by
specific identification, along with the results of any analysis
performed on that data.



B. Direct
Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and
furnish bases for estimates.


C. Indirect
Costs. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect
costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data
to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.


D. Other
Costs. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories
described above (e.g.,special tooling, travel, computer and
consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage
and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide
bases for pricing.


E. Royalties.
If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information
on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:


(1)
Name and address of licensor.


(2)
Date of license agreement.


(3)
Patent numbers.


(4)
Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty
is payable.


(5)
Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract
item or component on which the royalty is payable)


(6)
Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.


(7)
Unit price of contract item.


(8)
Number of units.


(9)
Total dollar amount of royalties.


(10)
If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of
the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of
specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).


F. Facilities
Capital Cost of Money. When you elect to claim facilities capital
cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit FormCASB-CMF
and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

Adjustments
based on cost indexes of labor or material. The contracting
officer should consider using an economic price adjustment clause
based on cost indexes of labor or material under the circumstances
and subject to approval as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)
of this section.
          
(1) A clause providing adjustment
based on cost indexes of labor or materials may be appropriate when-
               
(i) The
contract involves an extended period of performance with significant
costs to be incurred beyond 1 year after performance begins;
               
(ii) The contract
amount subject to adjustment is substantial; and

variables for labor and materials are too unstable to permit a reasonable
division of risk between the Government and the contractor, without
this type of clause.
          
(2) Any clause
using this method shall be prepared and approved under agency procedures.
Because of the variations in circumstances and clause wording that
may arise, no standard clause is prescribed.

profit for the prime contractor.
               
(iv) For contract
actions that are not awarded using competitive procedures, the fixed
hourly rates for services that meet the definition of “commercial service” that
are transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the
contractor under a common control may be the established catalog
or market rate when-
                    
(A) It is the established practice
of the transferring organization to price interorganizational transfers

or order includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at
its own risk. Also see 12.207 (b)
for further limitations on use of time-and-materials or labor-hour
contracts for acquisition of commercial
products and commercial services. 
                        
     
(e) Post award
requirements. Prior to an increase in the ceiling price of a time-and-materials
or labor-hour contract or order, the contracting officer shall-
          
(1) Conduct
an analysis of pricing and other relevant factors to determine if
the action is in the best interest of the Government;

(a) Definitions for the purposes of
Time-and-Materials Contracts.
     
Direct
materials means those materials that enter directly into the
end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.
     
Hourly
rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment
for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor
category specified in the contract that are-
                     
                                  
(1) Performed

Description.
A time-and-materials contract provides for acquiring supplies or
services on the basis of-
                     
                                  
(1) Direct labor hours at specified
fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative
expenses, and profit; and
          
(2) Actual
cost for materials (except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f)).
     
(c)
Application.
A time-and-materials contract may be used only when it is not possible
at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent
or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable
degree of confidence. See 12.207(b)
for the use of time-and-material contracts for certain commercial
services.
          
(1)
Government surveillance.
A time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive
to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore,
appropriate Government surveillance of contractor performance is
required to give reasonable assurance that efficient methods and
effective cost controls are being used.
          
(2)
Fixed
hourly rates.

(i) The contract shall specify separate
fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative
expenses, and profit for each category of labor (see 16.601(f)(1)).
               
(ii) For acquisitions
of other than commercial
products or commercial services awarded without adequate price competition
(see 15.403-1(c)(1)), the contract
shall specify separate fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead,
general and administrative expenses, and profit for each category
of labor to be performed by-
                    
(A) The contractor;
                    
(B) Each subcontractor;
and
                    
(C) Each division,
subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor under a common control.
               
(iii) For
contract actions that are not awarded using competitive procedures,
unless exempt under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, the fixed
hourly rates for services transferred between divisions, subsidiaries,
or affiliates of the contractor under a common control-
                    
(A) Shall
not include profit for the transferring organization; but
                    
(B) May include
profit for the prime contractor.
               
(iv) For contract
actions that are not awarded using competitive procedures, the fixed
hourly rates for services that meet the definition of “commercial service” that
are transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the
contractor under a common control may be the established catalog
or market rate when-
                    
(A) It is the established practice
of the transferring organization to price interorganizational transfers
at other than cost for commercial work of the contractor or any
division, subsidiary or affiliate of the contractor under a common
control; and
                    
(B) The contracting
officer has not determined the price to be unreasonable.
          
(3)
Material
handling costs. When included as part of material costs, material
handling costs shall include only costs clearly excluded from the
labor-hour rate. Material handling costs may include all appropriate
indirect costs allocated to direct materials in accordance with
the contractor's usual accounting procedures consistent with part  31.
     
(d)
Limitations.
A time-and-materials contract or order may be used only if-
                     
                                  
(1) The
contracting officer prepares a determination and findings that no
other contract type is suitable. The determination and finding shall
be-
               
(i) Signed by the contracting officer
prior to the execution of the base period or any option periods
of the contracts; and
               
(ii) Approved
by the head of the contracting activity prior to the execution of
the base period when the base period plus any option periods exceeds
three years; and
          
(2) The contract
or order includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at
its own risk. Also see 12.207 (b)
for further limitations on use of time-and-materials or labor-hour
contracts for acquisition of commercial
products and commercial services. 
                        
     
(e) Post award
requirements. Prior to an increase in the ceiling price of a time-and-materials
or labor-hour contract or order, the contracting officer shall-
          
(1) Conduct
an analysis of pricing and other relevant factors to determine if
the action is in the best interest of the Government;
          
(2) Document
the decision in the contract or order file; and
          
(3) When making
a change that modifies the general scope of-
               
(i) A contract,
follow the procedures at 6.303;
               
(ii) An order
issued under the Federal Supply Schedules, follow the procedures
at 8.405-6; or
               
(iii) An order
issued under multiple award task and delivery order contracts, follow

The clause may be used in contracts that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

All professional employees shall be compensated fairly and properly. Accordingly, the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees, in solicitations for negotiated contracts when the contract amount is expected to exceed 
					$750,000

This provision requires that offerors submit for evaluation a total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees working on the contract. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating unrealistically low professional employee compensation may be assessed adversely as one of the factors considered in making an award.

(For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The contractor actually paid $4.10. The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50. The contractor increases the rate actually paid to $4.75 per hour. The allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour.)

(5)
								                Use the clause at 52.227-13 with its Alternate II in the contract when necessary to effectuate an existing or future treaty or agreement.

435,52.227-14 Rights in Data-General.,May 2014,27.409(b)(1),C,"
     
(a)
						            Generally, a contract should contain only one data rights clause. However, where more than one is needed, the contract should distinguish the portion of contract performance to which each pertains.
     
(b)


(1)
								                Insert the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, in solicitations and contracts if it is contemplated that data will be produced, furnished, or acquired under the contract, unless the contract is-
               
(i)
										                    For the production of special works of the type set forth in 27.405-1, although in these cases insert the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, and make it applicable to data other than special works, as appropriate (see paragraph (e) of this section);
               
(ii)
										                    For the acquisition of existing data, commercial computer software, or other existing data, as described in 27.405-2 through 27.405-4 (see paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section);
               
(iii)
										                    A small business innovation research contract (see paragraph (h) of this section);
               
(iv)
										                    To be performed outside the United States (see paragraph (i)(1) of this section);

(vii)
										                    A contract involving cosponsored research and development in which a clause providing for less than unlimited right has been authorized (see 27.408).
          
(2)
								                If an agency determines, in accordance with 27.404-2(b), to adopt the alternate definition of ""Limited Rights Data"" in paragraph (a) of the clause, use the clause with its Alternate I.
          
(3)
								                If a contracting officer determines, in accordance with 27.404-2(c) that it is necessary to obtain limited rights data, use the clause with its Alternate II. The contracting officer shall complete paragraph (g)(3) to include the purposes, if any, for which limited rights data are to be disclosed outside the Government.
          
(4)
								                In accordance with 27.404-2(d), if a contracting officer determines it is necessary to obtain restricted computer software, use the clause with its Alternate III.

(5)
								                Use the clause with its Alternate IV in contracts for basic or applied research (other than those for the management or operation of Government facilities, and contracts and subcontracts in support of programs being conducted at those facilities or where international agreements require otherwise) to be performed solely by universities and colleges. The clause may be used with its Alternate IV in other contracts if in accordance with 27.404-3(a), an agency determines to grant permission for the contractor to assert claim to copyright subsisting in all data first produced without further request being made by the contractor. When Alternate IV is used, the contract may exclude items or categories of data from the permission granted, either by express provisions in the contract or by the addition of a paragraph (d)(4) to the clause (see 27.404-4).
          
(6)

The contractor’s response may provide an aid in determining whether the clause should be used with Alternate II and/or Alternate III.
     
(d)
						            Insert the clause at 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, in solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration work (other than basic or applied research to be performed solely by a university or college where the contract amount will be $500,000 or less) unless all the requirements for data are believed to be known at the time of contracting and specified in the contract (see 27.406-2). This clause may also be used in other contracts when considered appropriate. For example, if the contract is for basic or applied research to be performed by a university or college, and the contracting officer believes the contract effort will in the future exceed $500,000, even though the initial award does not, the contracting officer may include the clause in the initial award.
     
(e)

(4)
								                The clause may be modified in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (e) of 27.405-1.

The contract may set forth limitations consistent with the purposes for which the work is being acquired. While no specific clause of this subpart is required to be included in contracts solely for the acquisition, without disclosure prohibitions, of books, publications, and similar items in the exact form in which the items exist prior to the request for purchase (i.e., the off-the-shelf purchase of such items), or in other contracts where only existing data available without disclosure prohibitions is to be furnished, if reproduction rights are to be acquired, the contract shall include terms addressing such rights.

""Services"" also includes construction activities and all tangible personal property that will become an ingredient or component part of a construction project. Such tangible personal property retains its character as tangible personal property until it is installed as an ingredient or component part of a construction project in New Mexico. However, sales of tangible personal property that will become an ingredient or component part of a construction project to persons engaged in the construction business are sales of tangible personal property.

								                The contract will be for services to be performed in whole or in part within the State of New Mexico.

instructions must be mutually consistent.
     
(e)
Liquidation. Liquidation
of contract financing payments shall be on the same basis as the
computation of contract financing payments; that is, financing payments
computed on a whole contract basis shall be liquidated on a whole
contract basis; and a payment computed on a line item basis shall
be liquidated against that line item. If liquidation is on a whole contract
basis, the contracting officer shall use a uniform liquidation percentage
as the liquidation method, unless the contracting officer obtains
the concurrence of the cognizant payment office that the proposed
liquidation provisions can be executed by that office, or unless
agency regulations provide alternative liquidation methods.
     
(f)
Prompt
payment for commercial purchase payments. The provisions of subpart  32.9, Prompt
Payment, apply to contract financing and invoice payments for commercial
purchases in the same manner they apply to other than commercial purchases.
The contracting officer is responsible for including in the contract
all the information necessary to implement prompt payment. In particular,
contracting officers must be careful to clearly differentiate in
the contract between contract financing and invoice payments and
between items having different prompt payment times.

Installment
payment financing for commercial
products and commercial services. Contracting officers
may insert the clause at 52.232-30,
Installment Payments for Commercial
Products and Commercial Services, in solicitations and contracts
in lieu of constructing a specific clause in accordance with paragraphs
(b) through (e) of this section, if the contract action qualifies
under the criteria at 32.202-1(b)
and installment payments for the item are either customary or are
authorized in accordance with agency procedures.
          
(1)
Description. Installment
payment financing is payment by the Government to a contractor of
a fixed number of equal interim financing payments prior to delivery
and acceptance of a contract item. The installment payment arrangement
is designed to reduce administrative costs. However, if a contract
will have a large number of deliveries, the administrative costs
may increase to the point where installment payments are not in
the best interests of the Government.
          
(2)
Authorized
types of installment payment financing and rates. Installment
payments may be made using the clause at 52.232-30, Installment
Payments for Commercial
Products and Commercial Services, either at the 70 percent
financing rate cited in the clause or at a lower rate in accordance
with agency procedures.
          
(3)
Calculating
the amount of installment financing payments. The contracting
officer shall identify in the contract schedule those items for
which installment payment financing is authorized. Monthly installment
payment amounts are to be calculated by the contractor pursuant
to the instructions in the contract clause only for items authorized
to receive installment payment financing.
          
(4)
Liquidating
installment payments. If installment payments have been made
for an item, the amount paid to the contractor upon acceptance of
the item by the Government shall be reduced by the amount of installment
payments made for the item. The contractor’s request for final payment
for each item is required to show this calculation.

paragraph entitled ""Payment"" of the clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms
and Conditions-Commercial
Products and Commercial Services. If the contract will provide
for contract financing, the contracting officer shall construct
a solicitation provision and contract clause. This solicitation

at 32.205 is used, the solicitation
provision at 52.232-31,
invitation to Propose Financing Terms, shall be included. The contract
clause shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements
of this subpart and any agency regulations.
     
(b) Each contract
financing clause shall include:

of the-
               
(i) Computation of the financing payment
amounts (see paragraph (c) of this section);
               
(ii) Specific

(c) Computation
of amounts, and contractor entitlement provisions.

(1) Contracts
shall provide that delivery payments shall be made only for completed
supplies and services accepted by the Government in accordance with
the terms of the contract. Contracts may provide for commercial
advance and commercial interim payments based upon a wide variety
of bases, including (but not limited to) achievement or occurrence
of specified events, the passage of time, or specified times prior
to the delivery date(s). The basis for payment must be objectively
determinable. The clause written by the contracting officer shall
specify, to the extent access is necessary, the information and/or
facilities to which the Government shall have access for the purpose
of verifying the contractor’s entitlement to payment of contract
financing.
          
(2) If the
contract is awarded using the offeror-proposed procedure at 32.205, the clause constructed
by the contracting officer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section
shall contain the following:
               
(i) A statement
that the offeror’s proposed listing of earliest times and greatest
amounts of projected financing payments submitted in accordance
with paragraph (d)(2) of the provision at 52.232-31, invitation
to Propose Financing Terms, is incorporated into the contract, and
               
(ii) A statement
that financing payments shall be made in the lesser amount and on
the later of the date due in accordance with the financing terms
of the contract, or in the amount and on the date projected in the
listing of earliest times and greatest amounts incorporated in the
contract.
          
(3) If the
security accepted by the contracting officer is the contractor’s
financial condition, the contracting officer shall incorporate in
the clause constructed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section the
following-
               
(i) A statement that the contractor’s
financial condition has been accepted as adequate security for commercial financing
payments; and
               
(ii) A statement
that the contracting officer may exercise the Government’s rights
to require other security under paragraph (c), Security for Government
Financing, of the clause at 52.232-29,
Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Products and
Commercial Services, in the event the contractor’s financial
condition changes and is found not to be adequate security.
     
(d)
Instructions
for multiple appropriations. If contract financing is to be
computed for the contract as a whole, and if there is more than
one appropriation account (or subaccount) funding payments under
the contract, the contracting officer shall include, in the contract,
instructions for distribution of financing payments to the respective
funds accounts. Distribution instructions and contract liquidation
instructions must be mutually consistent.
     
(e)
Liquidation. Liquidation
of contract financing payments shall be on the same basis as the
computation of contract financing payments; that is, financing payments
computed on a whole contract basis shall be liquidated on a whole
contract basis; and a payment computed on a line item basis shall
be liquidated against that line item. If liquidation is on a whole contract
basis, the contracting officer shall use a uniform liquidation percentage
as the liquidation method, unless the contracting officer obtains
the concurrence of the cognizant payment office that the proposed
liquidation provisions can be executed by that office, or unless
agency regulations provide alternative liquidation methods.
     
(f)
Prompt
payment for commercial purchase payments. The provisions of subpart  32.9, Prompt

contracting officers must be careful to clearly differentiate in
the contract between contract financing and invoice payments and
between items having different prompt payment times.

529,52.232-31 Invitation to Propose Financing Terms.,Dec 2022,32.205,P,"
     
(a)
						            Under this procedure, each offeror may propose financing terms. The contracting officer must then determine which offer is in the best interests of the United States.
     
(b)
Solicitations. The contracting officer must include in the solicitation the provision at 52.232-31, invitation to Propose Financing Terms. The contracting officer must also-
          
(1)
								                Specify the delivery payment (invoice) dates that will be used in the evaluation of financing proposals; and
          
(2)
								                Specify the interest rate to be used in the evaluation of financing proposals (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section).
     
(c)
						            Evaluation of proposals.

(1)
								                When contract financing terms vary among offerors, the contracting officer must adjust each proposed price for evaluation purposes to reflect the cost of providing the proposed financing in order to determine the total cost to the Government of that particular combination of price and financing.
          
(2)
								                Contract financing results in the Government making payments earlier than it otherwise would. In order to determine the cost to the Government of making payments earlier, the contracting officer must compute the imputed cost of those financing payments and add it to the proposed price to determine the evaluated price for each offeror.
          
(3)
								                The imputed cost of a single financing payment is the amount of the payment multiplied by the annual interest rate, multiplied by the number of years, or fraction thereof, between the date of the financing payment and the date the amount would have been paid as a delivery payment. The imputed cost of financing is the sum of the imputed costs of each of the financing payments.
          
(4)
								                The contracting officer must calculate the time value of proposal-specified contract financing arrangements using as the interest rate the nominal discount rate specified in AppendixC of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) CircularA-94, ""Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,"" appropriate to the period of contract financing. Where the period of proposed financing does not match the periods in the OMB Circular, the interest rate for the period closest to the finance period shall be used. AppendixC is updated yearly, and is available from the Office of Economic Policy in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

610,52.242-4 Certification of Final Indirect Costs.,Jan 1997,42.703-2(f),C,"
     
(a)
General. In accordance with 
10 U.S.C. 3747
 and 41 U.S.C.4307, a proposal shall not be accepted and no agreement shall be made to establish final indirect cost rates unless the costs have been certified by the contractor.
     
(b)
						            Waiver of certification.

(1)
								                The agency head, or designee, may waive the certification requirement when-
               
(i)
										                    It is determined to be in the interest of the United States; and
               
(ii)
										                    The reasons for the determination are put in writing and made available to the public.
          
(2)
								                A waiver may be appropriate for a contract with-
               
(i)
										                    A foreign government or international organization, such as a subsidiary body of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;
               
(ii)
										                    A State or local government subject to the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendices V and VII;
               
(iii)
										                    An educational institution (defined as an institution of higher education in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart A, and 20 U.S.C. 1001) subject to the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix III; and

										                    A nonprofit organization (as defined in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200) subject to the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix IV.
     
(c)
						            Failure to certify.

(1)
								                If the contractor has not certified its proposal for final indirect cost rates and a waiver is not appropriate, the contracting officer may unilaterally establish the rates.
          
(2)
								                Rates established unilaterally should be-
               
(i)
										                    Based on audited historical data or other available data as long as unallowable costs are excluded; and
               
(ii)
										                    Set low enough to ensure that unallowable costs will not be reimbursed.
     
(d)
False certification. The contracting officer should consult with legal counsel to determine appropriate action when a contractor’s certificate of final indirect costs is thought to be false.
     
(e)
Penalties for unallowable costs.

10 U.S.C. 3743
 and 41 U.S.C.4303 prescribe penalties for submission of unallowable costs in final indirect cost rate proposals (see 42.709 for penalties and contracting officer responsibilities).

be prohibitive), the contracting officer may use the clause with
its Alternate I.

at 52.246-20, Warranty of
Services, in solicitations and contracts for services when a fixed-price
contract for services is contemplated and the use of warranty clause
has been approved under agency procedures; unless a clause substantially
the same as the clause at 52.246-19,
Warranty of Systems and Equipment under Performance Specifications
or Design Criteria, has been used.

Therefore, the contracting officer shall show in the solicitation a complete description of the commodity to be acquired and of packing requirements to determine proper transportation charges for the evaluation of offers. If supplies cannot be properly classified through reference to freight classification tariffs or if doubt exists, the contracting officer shall obtain the applicable freight classification from the transportation office. In some situations prospective contractors have established an official freight classification description that can be applied.
     
(b)


(1)
								                When the supplies being acquired are new to the supply system, nonstandard, or modifications of previously shipped items, and different freight classifications may apply, the contracting officer shall insert in solicitations the provision at 52.247-53, Freight Classification Description.

(a)
						            Transit privileges.

(1)
								                Transit arrangements permit the stopping of a carload or truckload shipment at a specific intermediate point en route to the final destination for storage, processing, or other purposes, as specified in carrier tariffs or rate tenders. A single through rate is charged from origin to final destination plus a transit or other related charge, rather than a more expensive combination of rates to and from the transit point.
          
(2)
								                The contracting officer shall consider possible benefits available to the Government through the use of existing transit arrangements or through efforts to obtain additional transit privileges from the carriers. Solicitations incorporating transit arrangements shall be restricted to f.o.b. origin offers, as f.o.b. destination offers can only quote fixed overall delivered prices at first destination.
          
(3)


(i)
										                    Traffic management personnel shall furnish information and analyses of situations in which transit arrangements may be beneficial. The quantity to be awarded must be of sufficient tonnage to ensure that carload/truckload shipments can be made by the contractor, and there should be reasonable certainty that shipments out of the transit point will be requested in carload/truckload quantities.
               
(ii)
										                    The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations the provision at 52.247-56, Transit Arrangements, when benefits may accrue to the Government because transit arrangements may apply.
     
(b)

(1)
								                In evaluations of f.o.b. origin offers for large quantities of supplies that contractors normally have in process or storage at intermediate points, contracting officers shall make use of contractors’ earned commercial transit credits, which are recorded with the carriers. A transit credit represents the transportation costs for a recorded tonnage from the initial point to an intermediate point. The remaining transportation charges from the intermediate point to the Government destination, because they are based on through rates, are frequently lower than the transportation charges that would apply for the same tonnage if the intermediate point were the initial origin point.
          
(2)
								                If transit credits apply, the contract shall state that the contractor shall ship the goods on prepaid commercial bills of lading, subject to reimbursement by the Government. The contracting officer shall ensure that this does not preclude a proper change in delivery terms under the Changes clause. The shipments move for the account and at the risk of the Government, as they become Government property at origin.
          
(3)
								                The contractor shall show the transportation and transit charges as separate amounts on the invoice for each individual shipment. The amount to be reimbursed by the Government shall not exceed the amount quoted in the offer.
          
(4)
								                The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-57, Transportation Transit Privilege Credits, when supplies are of such a nature, or when it is the custom of the trade, that offerors may have potential transit credits available and the Government may reduce transportation costs through the use of transit credits.

(a)
						            If it is advantageous to the Government, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to ship supplies, which have been acquired f.o.b. origin, to domestic destinations, including DoD air and water terminals by common carriers on commercial bills of lading. Such shipments shall not exceed 150 pounds by commercial air or 1,000 pounds by other commercial carriers and shall not have a security classification.
     
(b)
						            The contracting officer may authorize the shipments under paragraph (a) of this subsection to be consolidated with the contractor’s own prepaid shipments for delivery to one or more destinations, if all appropriate f.o.b. origin shipments under one or more Government contracts have been consolidated initially. The contractor may be authorized to consolidate less-than-carload or less-than-truckload Government shipments with its own shipments so that the Government can take advantage of lower carload or truckload freight costs. The Government shall assume its pro rata share of the combined shipment cost. Agency transportation personnel shall evaluate overall transportation costs before authorizing any movement to ensure savings to the Government consistent with other contract and traffic management considerations. When consolidation is authorized, a copy of the commercial bill of lading shall be mailed promptly to each consignee.
     
(c)
						            Shipments under prepaid commercial bills of lading, as authorized in paragraph (a) of this subsection, do not require a contract modification. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the supplies move for the account of, and at the risk of, the Government. The supplies become Government property when loaded on the carrier’s equipment and the contractor has obtained the carrier’s receipt. The contractor pays the transportation charges and is reimbursed by the Government. Loss or damage claims shall be processed in accordance with agency regulations.
     
(d)
						            The contractor’s invoice for reimbursement by the Government shall show the prepaid transportation charges as agreed (see paragraph (b) of this subsection), as a separate item for each individual shipment. The contractor shall support the transportation charges with a copy of the carrier’s receipted freight bill or other evidence of receipt, except as follows:
          
(1)
								                A Government agency may determine that receipted freight bills or other evidence of receipt are not required for transportation charges of $100 or less.
          
(2)
								                A Government agency may pay an invoiced but unsupported transportation charge of $250 or less per transaction (i.e., purchase, invoice, or aggregate billing or payment for multiple purchases), if-
               
(i)
										                    The contractor cannot reasonably provide a receipted freight bill; and
               
(ii)
										                    The agency has determined that the charges are reasonable. Determination of reasonableness may be based on-
                    
(A)
												                        Past experience (authenticated transportation charges for similar shipments);
                    
(B)
												                        Rate checks;
                    
(C)
												                        Copies of previous freight bills submitted by the contractor; or
                    
(D)
												                        Other information submitted by the contractor to substantiate the amount claimed.
          
(3)
								                Receipted freight bills in support of invoiced transportation charges of $100 or less are not required for reimbursement by the Government, if-
               
(i)
										                    The underlying contract specifies retention by the contractor of all records for at least 3 years after final payment under the contract; and
               
(ii)
										                    The contractor agrees to furnish evidence of payment when requested by the Government.
     
(e)
						            Shipments and invoices shall not be split to reduce transportation charges to $100 or less per transaction as a means of avoiding the required documented support for the charges. See paragraph (d)(2) of this subsection for unsupported transportation charges of $250 or less.
     
(f)
						            The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.247-65, F.o.b. Origin, Prepaid Freight-Small Package Shipments, in solicitations and contracts when f.o.b. origin shipments are to be made.
